## The problem it solves

## Challenges I ran into

On Neon Devnet Smart contract Deployment slow, server run out time. Sometimes it doesn't get deployed but the next day it got deployed.
"Transaction not found after 30 blocks"

By mistakeling try to call a non existent contract on astar and it still return success call.
